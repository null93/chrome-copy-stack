### About

Copy Stack is there when you need to copy multiple clips and reduce them into one value. Easily put clips on top of the stack by coping the value you want, and pop them off by pasting or deleting value visually. Reduce them into a single value that can be copied.

- Reduce by summation, difference, joining with new-line, & joining with comma
- Light & Dark theme (auto)
- Modern material design
- Use across multiple sites
- Automatically saves stack for later use

### Get Started

1. Install extension
2. Click on the extension icon to toggle for current tab
3. Choose reducer (hint: summation and difference will only add valid numbers to stack)
4. Copy clips you want to collect/reduce
5. When you are ready, click the copy button or clear the stack!
